# Feather
This is a small project that we intend to work on in our free time.
It is a mod loader similar to fabric or forge, but aimed at only making PVP Client-style mods (or QoL mods) such as keystrokes, cps, pack display, etc.

Currently, we have the mod loading done (although it's not the best) and not much else.

# UPDATE:
A new PVP client called "Feather" featuring a modding system came out shortly after we started working on this.
It's interesting how unoriginal people can be. This project was primarily abandoned anyways.
Kaimson is a clown.

# TODO:
- SDK so you can actually make mods
- Better mod loading
- Events
- GUI stuff
- 3D rendering
- Player variables accessibility (their speed, sprinting/sneaking status, etc)
- Documentation
